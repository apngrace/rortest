# rortest
Random Repo to learn and test with Ruby and Rails

Initial app created from [this guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html)
# Notes:
* My mac started with ruby 2.3.7 (which was too old) - followed the steps [here](https://medium.com/@IanRahman/how-to-upgrade-ruby-on-a-mac-a592c6085c63)
    * Command to run for first part of Step 4 is actually `$ gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
* Needed to install both node `brew install node` and yarn `brew install  yarn` to get the rails command to finish
